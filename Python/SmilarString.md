# String Similarity Calculation Documentation

## Introduction
This Python snippet calculates the percentage of similarity between two strings using the SequenceMatcher class from the difflib module. The similarity ratio is determined based on the number of matching characters between the two strings.

## Usage
To use this snippet, call the `similar()` function with two string parameters.

```python
from difflib import SequenceMatcher

def similar(a, b):
    return SequenceMatcher(None, a, b).ratio()

# Example usage
string1 = "example string 1"
string2 = "example string 2"
similarity_percentage = similar(string1, string2)
print(f"Similarity percentage: {similarity_percentage * 100}%")
```

## Function Description
### similar(a, b)
- **Parameters:**
  - `a` (str): The first string for comparison.
  - `b` (str): The second string for comparison.
- **Returns:**
  - `float`: The similarity ratio between the two strings, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 indicates a perfect match.
- **Description:**
  - Computes the similarity ratio between strings `a` and `b` using the SequenceMatcher class.
  - Returns the ratio as a float value.

## Example
Consider an example where:
- `string1 = "example string 1"`
- `string2 = "example string 2"`
The similarity percentage between `string1` and `string2` will be calculated, and the result will be printed.

## Notes
- Ensure that the difflib module is installed and imported correctly in your Python environment.
- The similarity ratio is computed based on the longest common subsequence of characters between the two strings.
- The returned similarity ratio ranges from 0.0 (no similarity) to 1.0 (identical strings).
