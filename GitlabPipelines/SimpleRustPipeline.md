# Rust Pipeline Template Documentation

## Introduction
This GitLab CI/CD pipeline template provides a basic setup for building, testing, and deploying Rust applications. It utilizes the Rust Docker image for the build environment and includes stages for each step of the development lifecycle.

## Pipeline Configuration

### Default Configuration
- **Image:** `rust:latest`
  - The Docker image used as the base environment for Rust development.
- **Tags:**
  - `docker`: Indicates that the jobs in this pipeline require Docker support.

### Stages
1. **Build:** Compiles the Rust code into executable binaries.
2. **Test:** Executes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the code.
3. **Deploy:** (Not implemented in the provided template)

### Jobs
#### Build
- **Stage:** `build`
- **Script:**
  - Executes `cargo build` to compile the Rust code into executable binaries.

#### Test
- **Stage:** `test`
- **Dependencies:** Depends on the successful completion of the `build` stage.
- **Script:**
  - Executes `cargo test` to run unit tests on the Rust codebase.

## Usage
To use this pipeline template, integrate it into your GitLab CI/CD configuration file (`gitlab-ci.yml`). You can customize the stages, jobs, and scripts according to your project requirements.

```yaml
default:
  image: rust:latest
  tags:
    - docker

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - cargo build

test:
  stage: test
  needs:
    - build
  script:
    - cargo test
```

## Notes
- Ensure that you have the necessary Docker environment and permissions to run Docker containers.
- Modify the script sections (`cargo build` and `cargo test`) as needed to accommodate your project's build and test requirements.
- Implement the `deploy` stage with appropriate deployment tasks if needed for your project.
