The given code snippet is responsible for formatting a string by removing leading and trailing whitespace and replacing whitespace in the middle with a specified character, which in this case is an underscore ('_').

### Code Snippet:
```javascript
let formatted_string = str.trim().replace(/\s/g, "_");
```

### Functionality:

1. **`trim()` Method:**
   - The `trim()` method removes whitespace from both ends of a string.
   - It eliminates any leading and trailing spaces, tabs, newlines, and other whitespace characters.

2. **`replace()` Method with Regular Expression:**
   - The `replace()` method is called on the result of the `trim()` operation.
   - It takes a regular expression as the first argument and a replacement string as the second argument.
   - In this case, the regular expression `/s/g` is used to match all whitespace characters globally in the string.
   - The replacement string `"_ "` is provided to replace each matched whitespace character with an underscore ('_').

### Example:
Suppose `str` is assigned the value `"  hello world  "`:

- **Before Formatting:** `"  hello world  "`
- **After `trim()`:** `"hello world"`
- **After `replace()`:** `"hello_world"`

### Usage:
- The formatted string can be used for various purposes, such as creating URLs, file names, or database keys where spaces are not allowed.
- It ensures consistency and removes unnecessary whitespace that may cause issues in further processing or display.

### Note:
- Ensure that the character used for replacement (in this case, underscore '_') is suitable for your use case and does not conflict with any requirements or conventions.
- This code snippet operates only on whitespace characters. If you need to replace other characters as well, modify the regular expression accordingly.
