The provided code snippet demonstrates how to execute an external process (in this case, a Python script) from a JavaScript application, read its stdout, and utilize the output.

```javascript
import { spawn } from 'node:child_process';

const python = spawn('python3', ["./src/scaper.py", url]);

// @ts-ignore
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    python.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
        resolve(JSON.parse(data.toString()));
    });
});
```

### Explanation:

1. **Importing `spawn` Function:**
   - The code begins by importing the `spawn` function from the built-in `child_process` module. This function is used to spawn a new process.

2. **Spawning a Process:**
   - The `spawn` function is called with the command to execute (`python3`) and an array of arguments (`["./src/scaper.py", url]`). This launches a new Python process, executing the `scaper.py` script with the provided `url` argument.

3. **Reading stdout:**
   - A promise is returned, indicating that the result of the Python script execution will be resolved asynchronously.
   - The `stdout` stream of the spawned Python process is listened to using the `on` method. Whenever data is available on the stdout stream, the provided callback function is executed.
   - Inside the callback function, the received data is parsed assuming it's in JSON format (`JSON.parse(data.toString())`).
   - Finally, the parsed data is resolved, fulfilling the promise with the result.

### Note:
- Ensure that the Python script (`scaper.py` in this case) is present at the specified path and is executable.
- Handle errors appropriately, such as using try-catch blocks or Promise rejections, to manage any potential issues that may arise during the process execution or data parsing.
- Consider potential security implications when executing external processes, especially when providing user input as arguments.
